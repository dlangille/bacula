               Release Notes for Bacula 11.0.0

This is a major new release with many new features and a number of
changes. Please take care to test this code carefully before putting it into
production.  Although the new features have been tested, they have not run in a
production environment.

Compatibility:
--------------
As always, both the Director and Storage daemon(s) must be upgraded at
the same time. Any File daemon running on the same machine as a Director
or Storage daemon must be of the same version.

Older File Daemons should be compatible with the 11.0.0 Director and Storage
daemons.  There should be no need to upgrade older File Daemons.

New Catalog format in version 11.0.0 and greater
-----------------------------------------------

This release of Bacula uses a new catalog format.  We provide a set of scripts
that permit to convert a 9.x and earlier versions to the new 11.0.0 format
(1023).  Normally, it is automatic, though this is a big change that takes
longer than usual. The upgrade process will require more or less twice the
size of the actual database.

This database upgrade should significantly increase performance when inserting
large number of Jobs with lots of Files into the database catalog.

If you start from scratch, you don't need to run the update_bacula_tables
script because the create_bacula_tables script automatically creates the new
table format.  However, if you are using a version of Bacula older than 5.0.0
(e.g.  3.0.3) then you need to run the update_bacula_tables script that will be
found in the <bacula>/src/cats directory after you run the ./configure command.
As mentioned above, before running this script, please backup your catalog
database, and when you do running it, be sure shutdown Bacula and be aware that
running the script can take some time depending on your database size.

===================================================================

Release 9.6.4

This is a major security and bug fix release. We suggest everyone
to upgrade as soon as possible.

One significant improvement is for the AWS S3 cloud driver. First the
code base has been brought much closer to the Enterprise version (still
a long ways to go). Second is that the community code now uses the latest
version of libs3 as maintained by Bacula Systems.  The libs3 code is
available as a tar file for Bacula version 9.6.4 at: 

   www.bacula.org/downloads/libs3-20200523.tar.gz

Note: Version 9.6.4 must be compiled with the above libs3 version or later.
To build libs3:
- Remove any libs3 package loaded by your OS
- Download above link
- tar xvfz libs3-20200523.tar.gz
- cd libs3-20200523
- make  # should have no errors
- sudo make install

Then when you do your Bacula ./configure <args> it should automatically
detect and use the libs3. The output from the ./configure will show
whether or not libs3 was found during the configuration. E.g.
   S3 support:                yes
in the output from ./configure.

Release 9.4.1

This is a minor bug fix release for 9.4.0.  It should fix a few of
the warning messages, but not all, on FreeBSD and Solaris.  More importantly
The ./configure process now properly detects that libs3 is installed
on your system.  If you do not want to use the Amazon S3 driver, this
update is not required.

In addition to this release, I have posted the current source code with
patches for libs3 to bacula.org. This package is needed if you wish to
build the S3 driver. You may download it from the following location:

https://www.bacula.org/downloads/libs3-20181010.tar.gz

21Dec18
 - Remove register attribute on variables as it is not supported by newer C++ 
   compilers
 - Fix regression from 9.2 when backporting Enterprise code in bsock code
 - Add missing default flag so that configure looks for libs3


=====================================================================
Release 9.4.0

This is a major release comprised of more than
13,000 lines of differences since version 9.2.2.  It has updates to Baculum
and small number of bug fixes and back ports from Bacula Systems Enterprise
since version 9.2.2, but primarily it has two new features ...

The main new feature is the addition support for using Amazon S3 (and other
*identical* S3 providers), and WORM tape cassettes.  Note: Azur, Oracle S3,
and Goggle S3 are not compatible with Amazon S3.

Release 9.2.1

This is a bug fix release. It also contains some refactoring. That said,
there are 10,909 lines of diff between release 9.2.0 and this release.
One major improvement is that this release should eliminate the persistent
problem we have seen with MySQL unhappy with zero DATETIME fields.  If you
have problems with that, please simply execute the script update_bacula_tables
found in the <bacula>/src/cats library.  It will modify the table default
values for DATETIME fields to be friendly to the whims of MySQL and MariaDB.

Release 9.2.0

This is one of the biggest Bacula release ever made.  It has
almost 540,000 lines of diff output between Release 9.0.8 and
this release.

This is a major new release with a new version number. It has been
very thoroughly tested, but as always, please backup any previous
version and test this version prior to putting it into production.

For the most part the changes were contributed to the Bacula 
project by Bacula Systems SA and myself, but there were a number
of other contributors that I thank.

Database Update
---------------
There are no changes required to the catalog database.

Compatibility:
--------------
As always, both the Community Director and Storage daemon(s) must be upgraded
at the same time.  Any File daemon running on the same machine as a Director
or Storage daemon must be of the same version.

Older File Daemons should be compatible with the 9.2.0 Director and Storage
daemons.  There should be no need to upgrade older File Daemons.

=======================================================

Release 9.0.7

This is a significant release because it now has the Windows code
reintegrated and updated to work with this version.  Other than
Baculum updates and the new Windows update, there is no significant
change to the other code.  

If you wish to use the Windows 9.0.7 File daemon binaries with 
your existing 9.0.x Bacula Director and Storage daemon it should
work fine but has not been tested.

The 64 bit version of the Windows binaries has been installed and
very quickly tested, as a consequence, please test it carefully before
putting into production.  There seem to be some minor installation errors
that are probably related to .conf files.  Also the Windows binaries do
not yet contain the tray-monitor or the old Exchange plug.  Both currently
fail to build.

=================================================================
Release 9.0.4
This is a minor bug fix release. The main fix in this release
is to allow SQLite3 to work.

Please note: SQLite3 has been depreciated for a long time. If the
community will step forward (as it did in this case) and prepare
the appropriate make_sqlite3_tables and update_sqlite3_tables files,
we can continue to leave the SQLite3 code in Bacula.  However, we
strongly urge users to update to MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL,
which are our supported SQL databases.

06Sep17

 - baculum: Fix language setting in config file
 - Upgrade to latest lz4.c to fix bug #2310 bus error on 64 bit Solaris

===============================================================

This is a minor bug fix release, but a few of the bugs are important.
The main items fixed are:

- Postgresql should now work with Postgresql prior to 9.0
  Note: the ssl connection feature added in 9.0 is not available on
  postgresql servers older than 9.0 (it needs the new connection API).
- The issues with MariaDB (reconnect variable) are now fixed
- The problem of the btape "test" command finding a wrong number
  of files in the append test was a bug.  It is now fixed.  It is
  unlikely that it affected anything but btape.
- The bacula-tray-monitor.deskop script is released in the scripts
  directory.
- We recommend that you build with libz and lzo library support (the
  developer packages must be installed when building, and the shared 
  object libraries must be installed at run time).  However we have
  modified the code so that Bacula *should* build and run with either
  or both libz or lzo absent.

23Jul17
 - Use Bacula in place of Libz variables so we can build with/without
   libz and lzo
 - Apply ideas from bug #2255 prettier status slots output
 - Configure and install bacula-tray-monitor.desktop
 - Fix btape test which counted files incorrectly on EOT
 - Fix bug #2296 where Bacula would not compile with postgres 8 or older
 - Fix bug #2294 Bacula does not build with MariaDB 10.2
 - baculum: Fix multiple directors support
 - baculum: Fix showing errors from the API

==================================================================

Release 9.0.1 12Jul17:

========

This is either the biggest Bacula release ever made or one of the
biggest ones. Even without the new Aligned Volumes source code, which
is substantial, there are over 400,000 lines of diff output between
Release 7.4.7 and the release of 9.0.0

This is a major new release with a new version number. It has been
very thoroughly tested, but as always, please backup any previous
version and test this version prior to putting it into production.

For the most part the changes were contributed to the Bacula 
project by Bacula Systems SA and myself, but there were a number
of other contributors that I thank.

Database Update
---------------
This version of Bacula requires a database update.  So either you or the
installation process must apply the update_bacula_tables script.  As a
precaution, please do a database dump or run your nightly database backup
prior to running the update script.

Compatibility:
--------------
As always, both the Community Director and Storage daemon(s) must be upgraded
at the same time.  Any File daemon running on the same machine as a Director
or Storage daemon must be of the same version.

Older File Daemons should be compatible with the 9.0.0 Director and Storage
daemons.  There should be no need to upgrade older File Daemons.

Packagers:
---------
There are a good number of new binaries (e.g.  bbconsjson, bdirjson,
bfdjson, and bsdjson) to install; a new tapealert script file that should
be installed; and some new shared objects (e.g.  libbacsd).  The
dvd-handler script has been removed.  Note also to run the
update_bacula_tables script after having dumped the catalog to bring any
existing catalog up to the new version needed for Bacula 9.0.0.

New Features:
-------------
Please see the New Features chapter of the manual for documentation on
the new features.  The new features are currently only in the New Features
chapter and have not yet been integrated into the main chapters of the
manual.

New Features (summary):
-----------------------

 - Major rewrite of the Storage daemon to: put all drivers in class 
   structures, provide better separation of core/driver code, add new 
   drivers (aligned volumes, cloud), simplifies core code, allows loadable
   device drivers much like plugins but which are better integrated into
   the SD.
 - There are a number of new Bacula Systems whitepapers available on
   www.bacula.org, and a few more will be coming in the next few months.
 - New unique message id will be added to every message (designed but
   not yet implemented).

Core Features:
 - Implement a drive usage counter to do round robin drive assignment

=======================
Release version 7.4.0

For the most part the changes were contributed to the Bacula 
project by Bacula Systems SA.

This is a new release with a new version number. It has been
very thoroughly tested, but as always, the new features may not
always work as expected.

The Catalog database format has not changed since version the
prior release (7.2.0).

Compatibility:
--------------
As always, both the Community Director and Storage daemon(s) must be upgraded
at the same time.  Any File daemon running on the same machine as a Director
or Storage daemon must be of the same version.

Older File Daemons should be compatible with the 7.4.0 Director and Storage
daemons.  There should be no need to upgrade older File Daemons.

New features and changes:
Please see the New Features chapter of the manual for documentation on
the new features.  The new features are currently only in the New Features
chapter and have not yet been integrated into the main chapters of the
manual.

================================================================
Release version 7.2.0

Bacula code: Total files = 733 Total lines = 303,426
The diff between Bacula 7.0.6 and Bacula 7.2.0 is 254,442
which represents very large change, for the most part 
contributed to the Bacula project by Bacula Systems SA.

This is a major new release with many new features and a
number of changes. Please take care to test this code carefully
before putting it into production.  Although the new features
have been tested, they have not run in a production environment.

============== !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ===================
New Catalog format in version 7.2.0 and greater
-----------------------------------------------
This release of Bacula uses a new catalog format.  We provide a script
(update_bacula_tables in bacula/src/cats and in bacula/updatedb) that
will update from Bacula 3.x, 5.2, or 7.0 to version 7.2.0 format.
The database upgrade is fast and simply.  As always we strongly 
recommand that you make a dump of your database prior to doing the
upgrade.

NOTE: The upgrade will work only for PostgreSQL and MySQL. Upgrading is
not (yet) supported for SQLite3.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


For packagers, if you change options, naming, and the way 
we link our shared object files, as at least one of you does,
you are creating a situation where the user may not be able
to run multiple versions of Bacula on the same machine, which
is often very useful, and in addition, you create a configuration
that the project cannot properly support.

Please note that the documentation has significantly changed.
You will need additional packages to build it such as inkscape.
Please see the README and README.pct files in the docs directory.
The packages come with pre-build English pdf and html files,
which are located in the docs/docs/manuals/en/pdf-and-html directory.

Packagers: please note that the Bacula LICENSE has changed, it is still
AGPLv3 and still open source. A new requirement has been added which
requires other projects using the source to keep the acreditations.

Packagers: please note that the docs license has changed. It is now 
licensed: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
This is a common open source license.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Compatibility:
--------------
As always, both the Community Director and Storage daemon(s) must be upgraded
at the same time.  Any File daemon running on the same machine as a Director
or Storage daemon must be of the same version.

Older File Daemons should be compatible with the 7.2.0 Director and Storage
daemons.  There should be no need to upgrade older File Daemons. However,
this has not been fully tested yet.  Since we expect some problems, please 
test before putting it into production.

New Features:
Please see the New Features chapter of the manual for documentation on
the new features.  The new features are currently only in the New Features
chapter and have not yet been integrated into the main chapters of the
manual.  Also, since there were so many new features, it is possible that
a few that previously existed in version 7.0.x are documented a second
time in the 7.2.0 new features section.

========================================
Release 7.0.0

 Bacula code: Total files = 713 Total lines = 305,722
 The diff between Bacula 5.2.13 and Bacula 7.0.0 is 622,577 lines,
 which represents very large change.

This is a major new release with many new features and a
number of changes. Please take care to test this code carefully
before putting it into production.  Although the new features
have been tested, they have not run in a production environment.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
For packagers, if you change options, naming, and the way 
we link our shared object files, as at least one of you does,
you are creating a situation where the user may not be able
to run multiple versions of Bacula on the same machine, which
is often very useful, and in addition, you create a configuration
that the project cannot properly support.

Please note that the documentation has significantly changed.
You will need additional packages to build it such as inkscape.
Please see the README and README.pct files in the docs directory.
The packages come with pre-build English pdf and html files,
which are located in the docs/docs/manuals/en/pdf-and-html directory.

Packagers: please note that the Bacula LICENSE has changed, it is still
AGPLv3 and still open source. A new requirement has been added which
requires other projects using the source to keep the acreditations.

Packagers: please note that the docs license has changed. It is now 
licensed: Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
This is a common open source license.
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
