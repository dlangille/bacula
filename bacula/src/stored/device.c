 *  Higher Level Device routines.
 *  Knows about Bacula tape labels and such
 *
 *  NOTE! In general, subroutines that have the word
 *        "device" in the name do locking.  Subroutines
 *        that have the word "dev" in the name do not
 *        do locking.  Thus if xxx_device() calls
 *        yyy_dev(), all is OK, but if xxx_device()
 *        calls yyy_device(), everything will hang.
 *        Obviously, no zzz_dev() is allowed to call
 *        a www_device() or everything falls apart.
 *
 * Concerning the routines dev->rLock()() and block_device()
 *  see the end of this module for details.  In general,
 *  blocking a device leaves it in a state where all threads
 *  other than the current thread block when they attempt to
 *  lock the device. They remain suspended (blocked) until the device
 *  is unblocked. So, a device is blocked during an operation
 *  that takes a long time (initialization, mounting a new
 *  volume, ...) locking a device is done for an operation
 *  that takes a short time such as writing data to the
 *  device.

 * Here are a few things to know:
 *  dcr->VolCatInfo contains the info on the "current" tape for this job.
 *  dev->VolCatInfo contains the info on the tape in the drive.
 *    The tape in the drive could have changed several times since
 *    the last time the job used it (jcr->VolCatInfo).
 *  dcr->VolumeName is the name of the current/desired tape in the drive.
 *
 * We enter with device locked, and
 *     exit with device locked.
 *
 * Note, we are called only from one place in block.c for the daemons.
 *     The btape utility calls it from btape.c.
