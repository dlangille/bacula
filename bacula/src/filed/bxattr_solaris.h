/*
 * This is a Solaris specific XATTR implementation.
 * 
 * Solaris extended attributes were introduced in Solaris 9
 * by PSARC 1999/209
 *
 * Solaris extensible attributes were introduced in OpenSolaris
 * by PSARC 2007/315 Solaris extensible attributes are also
 * sometimes called extended system attributes.
 *
 * man fsattr(5) on Solaris gives a wealth of info. The most
 * important bits are:
 *
 * Attributes are logically supported as files within the  file
 * system.   The  file  system  is  therefore augmented with an
 * orthogonal name space of file attributes. Any file  (includ-
 * ing  attribute files) can have an arbitrarily deep attribute
 * tree associated with it. Attribute values  are  accessed  by
 * file descriptors obtained through a special attribute inter-
 * face.  This logical view of "attributes as files" allows the
 * leveraging  of  existing file system interface functionality
 * to support the construction, deletion, and  manipulation  of
 * attributes.
 *
 * The special files  "."  and  ".."  retain  their  accustomed
 * semantics within the attribute hierarchy.  The "." attribute
 * file refers to the current directory and the ".."  attribute
 * file  refers to the parent directory.  The unnamed directory
 * at the head of each attribute tree is considered the "child"
 * of  the  file it is associated with and the ".." file refers
 * to the associated file.  For  any  non-directory  file  with
 * attributes,  the  ".." entry in the unnamed directory refers
 * to a file that is not a directory.
 *
 * Conceptually, the attribute model is fully general. Extended
 * attributes  can  be  any  type of file (doors, links, direc-
 * tories, and so forth) and can even have their own attributes
 * (fully  recursive).   As a result, the attributes associated
 * with a file could be an arbitrarily deep directory hierarchy
 * where each attribute could have an equally complex attribute
 * tree associated with it.  Not all implementations  are  able
 * to,  or  want to, support the full model. Implementation are
 * therefore permitted to reject operations that are  not  sup-
 * ported.   For  example,  the implementation for the UFS file
 * system allows only regular files as attributes (for example,
 * no sub-directories) and rejects attempts to place attributes
 * on attributes.
 *
 * The following list details the operations that are  rejected
 * in the current implementation:
 *
 * link                     Any attempt to create links between
 *                          attribute  and  non-attribute space
 *                          is rejected  to  prevent  security-
 *                          related   or   otherwise  sensitive
 *                          attributes from being exposed,  and
 *                          therefore  manipulable,  as regular
 *                          files.
 *
 * rename                   Any  attempt  to   rename   between
 *                          attribute  and  non-attribute space
 *                          is rejected to prevent  an  already
 *                          linked  file from being renamed and
 *                          thereby circumventing the link res-
 *                          triction above.
 *
 * mkdir, symlink, mknod    Any  attempt  to  create  a   "non-
 *                          regular" file in attribute space is
 *                          rejected to reduce the  functional-
 *                          ity,  and  therefore  exposure  and
 *                          risk, of  the  initial  implementa-
 *                          tion.
 *
 * The entire available name space has been allocated to  "gen-
 * eral use" to bring the implementation in line with the NFSv4
 * draft standard [NFSv4]. That standard defines "named  attri-
 * butes"  (equivalent  to Solaris Extended Attributes) with no
 * naming restrictions.  All Sun  applications  making  use  of
 * opaque extended attributes will use the prefix "SUNW".
