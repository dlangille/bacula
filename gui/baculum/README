Baculum - Bacula web interface

================================================================================

=== 1. FAQ ===

a) Why Jobs list and/or Media list windows do not show any content?

   In case when in Bacula Catalog database exist a lot of finished Jobs or Media
records, for example more than 2000, and window with Jobs or Media list do not
show any content, then please consider increase "memory_limit" option in php.ini
PHP configuration file to higher value than 256M. There is also possible to set
limit window list elements on webGUI in window tools option (on window bottom
bar), without changing "memory_limit" value.

b) Just after finish initial wizard there is not possible to login to Baculum

   From Baculum 7.2.0 has been changed format storing passwords. Passwords
stored by Baculum for HTTP Basic authentication are encrypted by MD5. It is default
alghoritm used by "htpasswd" program. Plain text passwords for HTTP Basic auth
are not longer supported by Baculum.
   From this reason good to check if used web server for Baculum is set to using
MD5 type passwords in HTTP Basic authentication.

c) Why time fields values contain invalid date/time values?
  This case can mean that timezone is not set for PHP in php.ini file or the
timezone value needs correction. To fix it please add (or update) "date.timezone"
value in php.ini file. For example:

date.timezone = "Europe/Warsaw"
