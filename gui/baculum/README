=== 1. Customized and restricted consoles ===

Baculum supports customized and restricted consoles for each logged in user.

Before using customized and restricted consoles please check location for
bconsole configuration files for each user. For do it, there is need to run
on Baculum webGUI configuration wizard and there is need to go to "Console"
wizard step (fourth step).

In "Console" wizard step there is field defined as:

Bconsole custom config file path: __________________

In this field there is required to define location for restricted consoles.
In defined path exists one keyword {user}. It will be replaced into current
logged in username.

For example, if there is logged user named "john", keyword {user} will be replaced
into "john".


Example:

"Bconsole custom config file path" is defined as:

/usr/local/bacula/etc/bconsole-{user}.conf

After login user "john" to Baculum webGUI, for each bconsole request will be
used file:

/usr/local/bacula/etc/bconsole-john.conf

It makes available to define some specific console access (or restricted access)
for each Baculum user.

For user named "willy" in above configured path according bconsole configuration
file will be:

/usr/local/bacula/etc/bconsole-willy.conf

etc...


NOTE!

In configuration wizard step "Console" there is also field:

"Bconsole admin config file path:": ___________________

Config file defined in this field will be used by administrator only. For this
reason the best practice is to define here console configuration file that gives
full access for administrator.

Administrator user and password will be defined in next configuration wizard
step named "Authorization" (fifth step).


Baculum users are defined on web server level as described in instruction
in attached to Baculum INSTALL file.

Example:

For creating users "john" and "willy" as Baculum HTTP Basic authorization users
there is need to create this users for example by:

# htpasswd /some/location/htpasswd/file john

# htpasswd /some/location/htpasswd/file willy

For case using other HTTP Basic authorization backends (for example LDAP) there
is need to define these users in this specific service.


Example of content custom consoles configuration file is below:

Console {
    Name = "BaculaRestrictedUser"
    Password = "XXXXXXXXX"
    CommandACL = show,.client,.jobs,.fileset,.pool,.storage,.jobs,.bvfs_update,
.bvfs_lsdirs,.bvfs_lsfiles,.bvfs_versions,.bvfs_get_jobids,.bvfs_restore,restore
    CatalogACL = *all*
    ClientACL = user-fd
    JobACL = somejob1,userjob
    PoolACL = Full-Pool
    StorageACL = VTL
    FileSetACL = somejob1-fileset,userjobFileSet3
    WhereACL = *all*
}

After defining these ACL there is also need to define the console access to
Director service in Bacula Director configuration file as Console{} resource.


NOTE!

Please note that in above example in CommandACL are shown the most
essential commands necessary for proper working of Baculum webGUI and
possibility do to restore action (all .bvfs_* command and "restore"
command)

Below are the same necessary commands broke one per line:

show
.client
.jobs
.fileset
.pool
.storage
.jobs
.bvfs_update
.bvfs_lsdirs
.bvfs_lsfiles
.bvfs_versions
.bvfs_get_jobids
.bvfs_restore
restore


Catalog Database restriction

Because Baculum in few parts of interface uses data from Bacula Catalog Database,
for each user who IS NOT administrator there has been disabled EVERY write to
Bacula Catalog database by Baculum webGUI. Modification Bacula Catalog Database
tables is possible ONLY for Baculum administrator.

Additionally because of Console ACL functionality does not support restriction
on media/volumes level, access to media/volumes has been disabled for all users
except administrator.


Configuration wizard restriction

For security reason there has been disabled access to Configuration Wizard
function for all users except administrator.


================================================================================

=== 2. Baculum users configuration file ===

There is possible to manage Baculum administrator login and password directly
in configuration wizard step titled "Step 5 - authorization params to Baculum".

It means that Baculum administrator may change admin auth params by
configuration wizard.

---------------- NOTE ---------------
In older Baculum versions (before 7.0.5) in Step 5 configuration wizard there were
need to input admin auth params the same as in pre-defined file by "htpasswd"
program.

In version 7.0.5 has been introduced partial support for possibility changing
username and password from Baculum interface working on Lighttpd web server.

From version 7.2.0 this limitation has been abolished. As long as Web Server uses
HTTP Basic auth file located in:

./protected/Data/baculum.users

and Web Server is capable to write (write permission) to this passwords file as
long is possible to change username and password from Baculum interface level.
------------ NOTE END -------------

=== 3. FAQ ===

a) Why Jobs list and/or Media list windows do not show any content?

   In case when in Bacula Catalog database exist a lot of finished Jobs or Media
records, for example more than 2000, and window with Jobs or Media list do not
show any content, then please consider increase "memory_limit" option in php.ini
PHP configuration file to higher value than 256M. There is also possible to set
limit window list elements on webGUI in window tools option (on window bottom
bar), without changing "memory_limit" value.

b) Just after finish initial wizard there is not possible to login to Baculum

   From Baculum 7.2.0 has been changed format storing passwords. Passwords
stored by Baculum for HTTP Basic authentication are encrypted by MD5. It is default
alghoritm used by "htpasswd" program. Plain text passwords for HTTP Basic auth
are not longer supported by Baculum.
   From this reason good to check if used web server for Baculum is set to using
MD5 type passwords in HTTP Basic authentication.

c) Why time fields values contain invalid date/time values?
  This case can mean that timezone is not set for PHP in php.ini file or the
timezone value needs correction. To fix it please add (or update) "date.timezone"
value in php.ini file. For example:

date.timezone = "Europe/Warsaw"
