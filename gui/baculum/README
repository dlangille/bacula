Baculum - Bacula web interface

=== FAQ ===

a) Why do job list or media list pages not show any content?

   In case when in the Bacula Catalog database exist a lot of records
(for example 20000 finished job records) and the Baculum web page does not show
any content, please consider increasing "memory_limit" option in php.ini
PHP configuration file to greater value than 128M. Information about exhausted
memory should be visible in web server error log. Alternatively there is also
possible set limit for visible elements in tables that does not require
increasing "memory_limit" value. This change can be done directly on
the Baculum Web interface at the gear wheel icon on the top left.

b) Why do time fields contain invalid date/time values?
  This case can mean that the timezone is not set for PHP or it needs to be
corrected. To fix it please add (or update) "date.timezone" value in php.ini
file, for example:

date.timezone = "Europe/Warsaw"
