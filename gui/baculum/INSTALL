1. Baculum overview


Baculum is Bacula web based interface. It enables Bacula administration
functions such as:

- Running Bacula jobs (backup, restore, verify...).
- Two services: Baculum API and Baculum Web
- Configuring Bacula on local and remote hosts
- Monitoring Bacula service status.
- Bacula console available via a Web window.
- Multi-user interface.
- Support for customized and restricted consoles (Console ACL function).
- Volume management.
- User friendly graphs and metrics.
- Basic storage daemon operations (mount, umount, release, ...).
- Easy to use configuration and restore wizards.
- Multiple Director support.
- Live AJAX based statuses.


2. Operating system environment


2.1 General requirements


Environment for Baculum API installation should have following components:

- Web Server - with mod_rewrite module loaded. Baculum has been
tested with Apache HTTP Server and Lighttpd.

- PHP 5.3 or higher - PHP CLI interpreter is unneeded.
PHP should have installed following modules:
    * PDO PHP support - depending on your catalog database: PDO PostgreSQL,
PDO MySQL or PDO SQLite.
      Note, in case using MySQL database there is required to use MySQL native driver.
      It is php-mysqlnd for PHP, not php-mysql.
    * BCMath PHP module.
    * JSON PHP module.
    * XML PHP module.
- Bconsole - configured Bacula text based console
- Access to Bacula catalog database - computer with Baculum API installation should be
able to connect to Bacula catalog database. There is not need to install Baculum
on server with Bacula Catalog DB because Baculum API can communicate with Bacula database
located on remote server.

Environment for Baculum Web installation should have following components:

- Web Server - with mod_rewrite module loaded. Baculum has been
tested with Apache HTTP Server and Lighttpd.

- PHP 5.3 or higher - PHP CLI interpreter is unneeded.
PHP should have installed following modules:
    * cURL PHP module.
    * MB String PHP module.
    * JSON PHP module.
    * XML PHP module.

3. Makefile


Together with Baculum source code is provided Makefile file. The Makefile is dedicated
mainly for separating and generating runtime files (including web servers configuration,
systemd unit and others).

Generating runtime files can be useful to prepare Baculum binary packages by execute
the Makefile in deb metafiles or in rpm SPEC file.

Example usage:

$ cd baculum/

# For RPM distributions:
$ make DESTDIR=/home/abc/baculum_runtime

# For deb distributions:
$ make DESTDIR=/home/abc/baculum_runtime SAMPLETYPE=deb-template HTTPDNAME=apache2 HTTPDSITECONF=sites-available
